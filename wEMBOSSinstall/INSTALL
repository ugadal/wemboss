Required Perl modules
=====================
wEMBOSS requires Mail::Mailer module from the MailTools package. This module is
not included with Perl distribution. You can download MailTools from
http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MA/MARKOV/MailTools-2.06.tar.gz
Please examine the README file of this package.
After unpacking the package, install by running these commands:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install 


How to install wEMBOSS
======================
To install wEMBOSS execute
	perl install.pl

If you can't  appropriately answer to all the questions,
don't worry, give a plausible answer and let the installation continue.
If you didn't succeed the first time because you didn't know
the answer to all the questions, you can now execute
	perl install.pl < yourAnswers
where yourAnswers is the file containing all your answers.
Before a new installation edit that file and modify the wrong answers.
Two myAnswers files are provided as examples.

The cgi directory used by wEMBOSS can't be the default cgi-bin directory of the
http server, because the users of this interface have to be authenticated.
In wEMBOSS V2 it is located where you have installed wEMBOSS in the directory 
called wEMBOSS_cgi.
If for example you have chosen to  install wEMBOSS V2 in /home/wEMBOSS2, 
the /home/wEMBOSS2/wEMBOSS_cgi directory will contain the cgi wrapper for
wEMBOSS.
You have to add some statements in the httpd.conf of the web-server (apache
or ...) : 

ScriptAlias /wEMBOSS_cgi/ /home/wEMBOSS2/wEMBOSS_cgi

    <Directory "/home/wEMBOSS2/wEMBOSS_cgi">
       AuthType basic
       AuthUserFile "/etc/shadow"      
       Authname "EMBOSS user"  
       require valid-user
    </Directory>

Depending of the configuration of your server the way to make the directory
accessible can be different. If you don't know, ask your server manager.

How to manage the authentication of wEMBOSS users
====================================================

The password file must not necessarily be /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow like
suggested above, but it must contain users that are known to the system and
have a valid UNIX home directory, in which wEMBOSS can write its output data.
The password file must be readable for the user that runs the httpd server
(nobody, www...). 
The file /etc/shadow is by default only readable by root, so you would need to
execute
chmod +r /etc/shadow
to make it world readable.	
To avoid making /etc/shadow or some other file you use as password file world
readable, you can put the user that runs the httpd server in a dedicated group
and let this group own the password file, e.g.
add in the file /etc/group a line
   shadow:x:15:nobody
then do
   chgrp shadow /etc/shadow
   chmod 640 /etc/shadow
   
An alternative way is to create a password file for wEMBOSS users using the
htpasswd program.
All the user names mentioned must be present in the shadow or passwd files of
the system but the passwords may be different. In the httpd.conf file you could then replace the line
		AuthUserFile "/etc/shadow"
by
		AuthUserFile "/home/wEMBOSS2/.htpasswd"
if you put there the password file.
To get more security you should make it only readable by the user that runs httpd (nobody or ...)
	chown nobody /home/wEMBOSS2/.htpasswd
	chmod 400 /home/wEMBOSS2/.htpasswd


How to exclude programs from wEMBOSS
====================================

By default wEMBOSS does not show programs that need to be run interactively
in a terminal or that are used to update the motif databases. You can customize
the list of excluded programs by editing the file
/home/wEMBOSS2/embossData/exclude.
 E.g. if you want to exclucde cirdna, add a line
cirdna           Draws circular maps of DNA constructs
