wEMBOSS-2
=========

wEMBOSS-2 is completely reorganized from the developer and manager point-of-vue.
wEMBOSS-2 has the same functionality as wEMBOSS-1.8.1 for the users.
wEMBOSSDEV-2 for the developer is now a project in Eclipse using the Epic
plug-in.
wEMBOSSDIST-2.x is the corresponding distribution package. It is distributed as
successive releases with version numbers. We are starting the distribution at
version 2.1.

What is different, in a few words :
wEMBOSS does not install anymore its modules in the Perl system libraries.
This is completely justified because the wEMBOSS Perl code is used first at
installation time and later at wEMBOSS run time but never as reusable code for
other applications.
  
Thus after installation you can find wEMBOSS-2 files only at 3 places :
	- where you put the distribution package (of course)
	- where you did install it (wEMBOSS home)
	- under the document root of your Web server, where are all the files
          needed to create the Web pages (html, images, css, js, ...).
	- a fourth place could be the one where you have put all your personal
          stuff that successive installations could otherwise have erased !


The wEMBOSS.pm module has been split into 8 modules each one corresponding to
one of the 8 possible actions  (project management, menu of programs, program
page, run ...) 
Part of the code is rewritten for clarity, the others parts will be rewritten
later.

My idea is to facilitate my succession for a new wEMBOSS developer.

I am now retired so its more easy to spend time on it!
